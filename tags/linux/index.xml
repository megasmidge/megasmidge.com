      <description>Well I had a plan, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t go quite how I expected. RDP was just way too rough to play Dead By Daylight. Luckily, Steam made a tool called Steam Link that you can install on a linux machine or mobile device. It allows you to run the games from your main computer, and see the games on your remote computer. You send your keyboard/mouse from the remote computer to the main computer to play the game.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Windows user most of my 34 years on this earth. It was a matter of what my parents had in the house growing up in the 90s. As someone who got into videogames at a young age, Windows was the only way to go at the time. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in building anything or being super technical, and it never even crossed my mind that I could be &amp;ldquo;good at computers&amp;rdquo; to pay the bills.</description>
