      <description>Well I had a plan, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t go quite how I expected. RDP was just way too rough to play Dead By Daylight. Luckily, Steam made a tool called Steam Link that you can install on a linux machine or mobile device. It allows you to run the games from your main computer, and see the games on your remote computer. You send your keyboard/mouse from the remote computer to the main computer to play the game.</description>
